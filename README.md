# NSX-Loadbalancer

This is a basic build script that will clone a template VM's. With however many you want in the range.  Then turn around and add those VM's automatically behind a load balancer.

The majority of the NSX portion interacting with the NSX API was taken from Chris Wahl.  I had to then turn around and add logic to the api calls to get it to work properly.  This was a quick script I need to make future commits!
